# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, purchase of a burrito for [Rob Schultheis](https://github.com/rschultheis) is mandatory.

All commit messages must have a burrito pun.

i.e. "Got the routes all wrapped up"

Actually, just show up to a Coffee-n-code event (or don't),
make a proposal for what you'd ike to contribute, and do it!
